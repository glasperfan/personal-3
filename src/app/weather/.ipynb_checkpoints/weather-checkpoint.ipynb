    "Despite the endless criticism of TV meterologists, weather prediction is essentially modeling a system with virtually infinite significant inputs and neverending sources of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Weather Service (NWS), a component of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - itself, an Operating Unit of the US Department of Commerce - is responsible for collecting global data on weather, water, and climate data, as well as forecasting future weather conditions in order to ensure physical safety and economic security (hence, the Commerce association). The NOAA has 2 supercomputers churning away on weather data analysis, for a combined processing power of 5.78 petaflops. A petaflop, by the way, represents a *quadrillion* floating-point operations per second. In order to process real-time data from local observers, weather balloons, weather stations, planes, and satellites, a colossal amount of computer power is required to aggregrate and analyze it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These supercomputers are also powering many of the NOAA's numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. One example is the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (HRRR), described [here](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/). This model gathers radar data both every 15 minutes on top of hourly data from another Rapid Refresh (RAP) model, offering a 4x boost in resolution with respect to speed and distance covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So how good are these models?\n",
    "A common but poor baseline for prediction is the historical average, which averages weather conditions over the same day (say, July 16th) for a series of years to predict conditions for the next occurrence of that date. It's poor because it assumes that weather is constant at the same time each year (July 16th, 2016 will be similar to July 16th, 2017), nor does it consider weather on the preceding days (July 14th, 15th, etc). For example, in his book, *The Signal and the Noise*, Nate Silver discusses weather forecasting and notes that historical temperature averages generate predictions with an average of 7&deg;F error - obviously, not great. What's more interesting is that **even commerical models fail to predict better than historical averages after about 10 days** (see chart [here](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/21/we-can-only-forecast-the-weather-a-few-days-into-the-future/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast Watch published a [December 2016 review](http://forecastwatch.com/static/Three_Region_Overview_2010_201606.pdf) of forecast accuracy for 3 regions (US, Europe, Asia-Pacific) that spanned the previous 6 years and collected over 150 million predictions from major national and international weather services. A \"correct prediction\" was defined as one of the following:\n",
    "- high temperature forecast &plusmn; 3&deg;F\n",
    "- low temperature forecast &plusmn; 3&deg;F\n",
    "- an icon/text forecast that correctly predicts precipitation (binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at U.S. results only. The Weather Channel, for example, had an accuracy rate of 76.21% in 2016 for 1 to 3 days out, growing from 72.08% in 2012. And The Weather Channel had the *highest* accuracy. World Weather Online predicted correctly only 63.56% for the same range of 1-3 days. Note that blind guessing does not represent 50% accuracy, as temperature $T$ is a continuous rather than binary variable. Accuracy then drops for predictions farther in the future. The Weather Channel scores 69.63% for 3-5 days out and 58.79% for 6-9 days out, each time claiming the title of highest accuracy for the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some services claim to have better results. The Met Office in the UK [boasts 92% accuracy](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/accuracy/forecasts) with respect to next day temperature prediction within 2&deg; Celsius. Equally interesting is the high public confidence in Met Office predictions. A [February 2017 survey](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/accuracy/trust) shows that 84% of British respondents trust the Met Office \"a lot\" or \"a little\", with 41% saying \"a lot\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy also varies depending on what weather condition you're predicting. For example, Nate Silver also shows that The Weather Service (over at [weather.gov](http://weather.gov)) is fairly precise about predicting precipitation. However, one must also consider the well-known phenomenon of *wet bias* - the over-prediction of rain due to the *lower cost* of over-prediction than under-prediction. People don't tend to mind a sunny day if it was predicted to be a rainy one, but they very much mind the opposite. Statistically speaking, if $\\hat{y}=1$ is our binary precipitation prediction (it will rain or not) and $y=1$ means that it actually rained, while $y=0$ means it did not rain, we say there is a higher cost associated with a false negative ($FN: \\hat{y}=0, y=1$) than a false positive ($FP : \\hat{y}=1, y=0$)."

    "### How far have we come?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nate Silver provides several pieces of data that suggest we are definitely improving:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] The National Hurricane Center predicts where a hurricance will make landfall 3 days prior to the event. Over the past 25 years, its average error has fallen from 350 miles to 100 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] The chance of an American dying from a lightning strike has fallen from 1 in 400,000 to 1 in 11 million since 1940.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] The National Weather Service average error when predicting high temperatures 3 days out has fallen from 6&deg;F to 3&deg;F since 1972.\n",
    "\n",
    "But prediction accuracy is far from ideal, and it can lead to devastating consequences in the form of unexpected earthquakes and tsunamis. The 2011 earthquake in Japan (9.0 on the Richter scale) is a case in point."
